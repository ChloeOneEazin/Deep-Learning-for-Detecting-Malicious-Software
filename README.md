# Deep Learning for Detecting Malicious Software

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for the Final Year Project (FYP) titled Deep Learning for Detecting Malicious Software. The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques including CNN, ResNet, Xception and Inception and transformer DeiT with Spatial Aggregation Vector Encoding (SAVE) to accurately classify malware images into benign or malicious categories.

## 📊 Task Overview

The primary objectives of this FYP are:

**1. Problem Statement: ** Malware poses a significant security threat. Traditional signature-based detection methods struggle with new and obfuscated samples. Deep learning approaches can learn rich visual patterns from malware images, improving detection of novel variants.

**2. Goals:**
- Implement and compare multiple architectures (ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, Custom CNN) enhanced with SAVE layers.
- Evaluate models using classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and confusion matrices.

**3. Methodology:** Data preprocessing → Model design → Training and validation → Prediction generation → Performance analysis.

### 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChloeOneEazin/Deep-Learning-for-Detecting-Malicious-Software.git
cd Deep-Learning-for-Detecting-Malicious-Software

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open Jupyter Notebooks:
Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to navigate to any .ipynb file inside the relevant subfolders and execute the cells sequentially to train or test a model.

Review Results:
After training, you will find saved models, classification reports, confusion matrix plots, and training history visualizations generated by the notebooks.
